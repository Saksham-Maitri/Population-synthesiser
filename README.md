# Population-synthesiser
The Population Synthesizer project is a Python-based tool designed to extend a given dataset of demographic information for a city population. Initially, the dataset consists of detailed information on 200,000 individuals, including their sex, age category, and level of education. However, for various analytical purposes or simulation studies, there might be a need to work with a more compact dataset or to extend it to a larger population size while maintaining the similarity in distribution.

The main objective of the Population Synthesizer is to take the original dataset of 200,000 individuals and synthesize a new dataset containing 5,000 individuals while preserving the distribution characteristics of the original dataset. This involves careful statistical analysis and modeling to ensure that the synthesized population accurately reflects the demographics of the original population.
